You can control the size of an image using the width and height properties in CSS, just
like you can for any other box.

Specifying image sizes helps pages to load more smoothly because the HTML and CSS code will often load before the images, and telling the browser how much space to leave for an image allows it to render the rest
of the page without waiting for the image to download.

You can specify class names that allow any element to be centered, in the same way that
you can for the dimensions or alignment of images.


The background-image property allows you to place an image behind any HTML element.

When an image is not being repeated, you can use the background-position property to specify where in the
browser window the background image should be placed.


The background property acts like a shorthand for all of the other background properties you have just seen, and also the background-color property.

Using CSS, it is possible to create a link or button that changes to a second style when a user moves
their mouse over it (known as a rollover).



Search Engine Optimization (SEO):

SEO is a huge topic and several books have been written on the subject. The following pages will help you understand the key concepts so you can improve your website's visibility on search engines.


On-page techniques are the methods you can use on your web pages to improve their rating in search engines.

The main component of this is looking at keywords that people are likely to enter into a search
engine if they wanted to find your site, and then including these in the text and HTML code
for your site in order to help the search engines know that your site covers these topics. 


Determining which keywords to use on your site can be one of the hardest tasks when you start to think about SEO.


It is very unlikely that your site will appear at the top of the search results for every
keyword.


As soon as people start coming to your site, you can start analyzing how they found it, what they were looking at and at what point they are leaving. One of the best tools for doing this is a free service offered by
Google called Google Analytics.




The content link on the left-hand side allows you to learn more about what the visitors are looking at when they come to your site.


To transfer your code and images from your computer to your hosting company, you use
something known as File Transfer Protocol.


FTP programs allow you to transfer files from your local computer to your web server.


Many companies provide platforms for blogging, email newsletters, e-commerce and other popular website
tools (to save you writing them from scratch).



HTML5 video and audio:

HTML5 comes with elements for embedding rich media in documents — < video > and < audio> — which in turn come with their own APIs for controlling playback, seeking, etc.



 The HTMLMediaElement.paused property returns true if the media is paused, which is any time the video is not playing, including when it is set at 0 duration after it first loads.


  If it is paused, we set the data-icon attribute value on the play button to "u", which is a "paused" icon, and invoke the HTMLMediaElement.play() method to play the media.


On the second click, the button will be toggled back again — the "play" icon will be shown again, and the video will be paused with HTMLMediaElement.pause().



The HTMLMediaElement API makes a wealth of functionality available for creating simple video and audio players, and that's only the tip of the iceberg.

There are lots of occasions when we need to use lists.
There are three different types of lists:

1. Ordered lists <ol>:

2. Unordered lists<ul>:

3. Definition lists<dl>:

Nested Lists:
You can put a second list inside
an <li> element to create a sublist
or nested list.

**CSS**:

To set your own dimensions for a box you can use the height and width properties.
The most popular ways to specify the size of a box are to use pixels, percentages, or ems.



Limiting Width:

Some page designs expand and shrink to fit the size of the user's screen.
 In such designs, the min-width property specifies the smallest size a box can be displayed at when the browser window is narrow, and the max-width property indicates the maximum width a box can stretch to when the browser window is wide.

 Limiting Height:

 In the same way that you might want to limit the width of a box on a page, you may also want to limit the height of it.
This is achieved using the min-height and max-height properties.

Overflowing Content:
The overflow property tells the browser what to do if the content contained within a box is larger
than the box itself.


Border Width:

The border-width property is used to control the width of a border. The value of this property can either be given in pixels.


Border Style:
You can control the style of a border using the border-style property.


Border Color:

You can specify the color of a border using either RGB values, hex codes or CSS color names.


Padding:

The padding property allows you to specify how much space should appear between the content of an element 
and its border.

Margin:

The margin property controls the gap between boxes. Its value is commonly given in pixels, although you may also use percentages or ems.


Display:

The display property allows you to turn an inline element into a block-level element or vice versa, and can also be used to hide an element from the page.



**JS**


Arrays:
An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values.

CREATING AN ARRAY:

You create an array and give it a name just like you would any other variable (using the varbkeyword followed by the name of the array).

VALUES IN ARRAYS:

Values in an array are accessed as if they are in a numbered list. It is important to know that the
numbering of this list starts at zero (not one).


SWITCH STATEMENTS:

A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value. Each case indicates a possible
value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value.

If you use a data type JavaScript did not expect, it tries to make sense of the operation rather
than report an error.

Due to type coercion, every value in JavaScript can be treated as if it were true or false; and
this has some interesting side effects.

Because the presence of an object or array can be considered truthy, it is often used to check
for the existence of an element within a page.


loops:

loops check a condition, if it returns T, thr code will run.
Loops are very helpful when dealing with arrays if you want to run the same code for each item
in the array.
=======
Links are the defining feature of the web because they allow you to move from
one web page to another â€” enabling the very idea of browsing or surfing.

Links are created using the <a> element. Users can click on anything between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag.

Directory Structure:
On larger websites it's a good idea to organize your code by placing the pages for each different section of the site into a new folder. Folders on a website are sometimes referred to as directories.

Email Links:
mailto: To create a link that starts up the user's email program and addresses an email to a specified
email address.

**css**

It is common to group a number of elements together inside a <div> (or other block-level) element.

Normal Flow:
In normal flow, each block-level element sits on top of the next one.

Relative Positioning:
Relative positioning moves an element in relation to where it would have been in normal flow.


Overlapping Elements:
When you use relative, fixed, or absolute positioning, boxes can overlap. If boxes do overlap, the
elements that appear later in the HTML code sit on top of those that are earlier in the page.

Fl oating Elements:
The float property allows you to take an element in normal flow and place it as far to the
left or right of the containing element as possible.

Screen Sizes:
Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to work on a range of different sized screens.

Screen Resolution:
Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch. Some devices have a higher resolution than desktop computers and most operating systems allow users to adjust the resolution of their screens.

A Liquid Layout:
The liquid layout uses percentages to specify the width of each box so that the design
will stretch to fit the size of the screen.


CSS Frameworks:
CSS frameworks aim to make your life easier by providing the code for common tasks, such as creating layout grids, styling forms, creating printer-friendly versions of pages and so on.


**JS**

WHAT IS A FUNCTION?
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task.

Declaring functions:
you can excute all of the statements between curly braces with just one line of code.

FUNCTION EXPRESSION:
In function expressions, the name is usually omitted. A function with no name is called an anonymous function.

INVOKED FUNCTION EXPRESSIONS:
This way of writing a function is used in several different situations.
Often functions are used to ensure that the variable names do not conflict with each other.

VARIABLE SCOPE:
The location where you declare a variable will affect where it can be used within your code.
If you declare it within a function, it can only be used within that function. This is known as the variable's cope.



Reasons for Pair Programming:
1. Greater efficiency.
2. Engaged collaboration.
3. Learning from fellow students.
4. Social skills.
5. Job interview readiness.
6. Work environment readiness.

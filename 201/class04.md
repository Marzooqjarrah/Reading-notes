Links are the defining feature of the web because they allow you to move from
one web page to another â€” enabling the very idea of browsing or surfing.

Links are created using the <a> element. Users can click on anything between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag.

Directory Structure:
On larger websites it's a good idea to organize your code by placing the pages for each different section of the site into a new folder. Folders on a website are sometimes referred to as directories.

Email Links:
mailto: To create a link that starts up the user's email program and addresses an email to a specified
email address.

It is common to group a number of elements together inside a <div> (or other block-level) element.

Normal Flow:
In normal flow, each block-level element sits on top of the next one.

Relative Positioning:
Relative positioning moves an element in relation to where it would have been in normal flow.


Overlapping Elements:
When you use relative, fixed, or absolute positioning, boxes can overlap. If boxes do overlap, the
elements that appear later in the HTML code sit on top of those that are earlier in the page.

Fl oating Elements:
The float property allows you to take an element in normal flow and place it as far to the
left or right of the containing element as possible.

Screen Sizes:
Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to work on a range of different sized screens.

Screen Resolution:
Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch. Some devices have a higher resolution than desktop computers and most operating systems allow users to adjust the resolution of their screens.

A Liquid Layout:
The liquid layout uses percentages to specify the width of each box so that the design
will stretch to fit the size of the screen.


CSS Frameworks:
CSS frameworks aim to make your life easier by providing the code for common tasks, such as creating layout grids, styling forms, creating printer-friendly versions of pages and so on.

WHAT IS A FUNCTION?
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task.

Declaring functions:
you can excute all of the statements between curly braces with just one line of code.

FUNCTION EXPRESSION:
In function expressions, the name is usually omitted. A function with no name is called an anonymous function.

INVOKED FUNCTION EXPRESSIONS:
This way of writing a function is used in several different situations.
Often functions are used to ensure that the variable names do not conflict with each other.

VARIABLE SCOPE:
The location where you declare a variable will affect where it can be used within your code.
If you declare it within a function, it can only be used within that function. This is known as the variable's cope.

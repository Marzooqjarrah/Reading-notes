web applications have had none of these luxuries. Cookies were invented early in the web’s history, and indeed they can be used for persistent local storage of small amounts of data. 


Before HTML5, all attempts to achieve suitable coditions were ultimately unsatisfactory in different ways.

userData allows web pages to store up to 64 KB of data per domain, in a hierarchical XML-based structure.
IE does not present any form of permissions dialog, and there is no allowance for increasing the amount of storage available.


In 2002, Adobe introduced a feature in Flash 6 that gained the unfortunate and misleading name of “Flash cookies”.


In 2007, Google launched Gears, an open source browser plugin aimed at providing additional capabilities in browsers.

By 2009, dojox.storage could auto-detect (and provide a unified interface on top of) Adobe Flash, Gears, Adobe AIR, and an early prototype of HTML5 storage that was only implemented in older versions of Firefox.

 what is HTML5 Storage? 
 Simply put, it’s a way for web pages to store named key/value pairs locally, within the client web browser. Like cookies.


 HTML5 Storage is based on named key/value pairs. You store data based on a named key, then you can retrieve that data with the same key.


 If you want to keep track programmatically of when the storage area changes, you can trap the storage event. 


 This specification has reached an impasse: all interested implementors have used the same SQL backend (Sqlite), but we need multiple independent implementations to proceed along a standardisation path.  
 Until another implementor is interested in implementing this spec, the description of the SQL dialect has been left as simply a reference to Sqlite, which isn't acceptable for a standard.

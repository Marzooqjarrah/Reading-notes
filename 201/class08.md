Layout:

CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level
box or an inline box.


The float property allows you to take an element in normal flow and place it as far to the left or right of the containing element as possible.

The clear property allows you to say that no element (within the same containing element) should touch the left or righthand sides of a box. 

margin:This creates a gap between the columns.

Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to work on a range of different sized screens.


Because screen sizes and display resolutions vary so much, web designers often try to create pages of around 960-1000 pixels wide


Liquid layout designs stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the
size of their browser window.

The liquid layout uses percentages to specify the width of each box so that the design
will stretch to fit the size of the screen.

CSS frameworks aim to make your life easier by providing the code for common tasks, such as creating layout grids, styling forms, creating printer-friendly versions of pages and so on.

{HTML}

All websites use HTML and CSS, but content
management systems, blogging software, and
e-commerce platforms often add a few more
technologies into the mix.
How the Web Works?
When you visit a website, the web server
hosting that site could be anywhere in the
world. In order for you to find the location of
the web server, your browser will first connect
to a Domain Name System (DNS) server.
structure of HTML:
HTML describes the structure of pages, consist from elements called tags.
- Tags act like containers. They tell you something about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags.
- Attributes: tell us more about elements.
- HTML pages are text documents.
- To learn HTML you need to know what tags are available for you to use, what they do, and where they can go.
Because there have been several versions of HTML, each web page should begin with a DOCTYPE declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using.

* To make a comment in html:
you can add the text between these characters.

* ID Attribute:
Every HTML element can carry the id attribute. It is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page (to make it distinguish).It is important that no two
elements on the same page have the same value for their id attributes.


* Class Attribute:
to identify several elements as being different from the other elements on the page.

* Block Elements:
Elements that start on a new line in the browser window.(<h1>, <p>, <ul>, and <li>).

* Inline Elements:
Elements that appear to continue on the same line as their neighbouring elements. (<a>, <b>, <em>, and <img>).

* Grouping Text & Elements In a Block (<div>):
allows you to group a set of elements together in one block-level box.

* Grouping Text & Elements Inline(<span>):
Used to Contain a section of text
where there is no other suitable
element to differentiate it from its surrounding text or to Contain a number of inline elements 
and you can control the appearance of the content of these elements using CSS.

* IFrames (<iframe>):
An iframe is like a little window that has been cut into your page â€” and in that window you can see another page.
*Information AboutYour Pages: (<meta>):
   The <meta> element lives inside the <head> element and contains information about that web page. 
   It is not visible to users but fulfills a number of purposes such as telling search engines about your page, who created it, and whether or not it is time sensitive.
   It is an empty element so it does not have a closing tag. It uses attributes to carry the information.

Headers & Footers (<header> <footer>) :
  Header: used to contain the site name and the main navigation and contain the title and date of each individual post.
  Footer: contains copyright information, along with links to the privacy policy and terms and conditions and links to share the article on social networking sites.  

Navigation (<nav>):
  used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site. some of the developers that were already using HTML5 decided to use the <nav> element for the links that
  appear at the bottom of every page.

Articles(<article>):
  acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated.

Asides (<aside>):
  It has two purposes, depending on whether it is inside an <article> element or not.
  - For inside : it should contain information that is related to the article but not essential to its overall meaning.
  - For outside: it acts as a container for content that is related to the entire page.

Sections (<section>):
  groups related content together and typically each section would have its own heading.

Heading Groups (<hgroup>):
  to group together a set of one or more <h1> through <h6> elements so that they are treated as one single heading.

Figures (<figure>):
  to contain any content that is referenced from the main flow of an article (not just images). 
  Examples of usage include:(Images, Videos, Graphs, Diagrams, Code samples, Text that supports the main body of an article).

Sectioning Elements (<div>):
  to group together related elements.

 - When you decide to create your website?
    first of all, you should know who your visitors are, you need to consider why they are coming. While some people will simply chance across your
    website, most will visit for a specific reason.
- It is unlikely that you will be able to list every reason why someone visits your site but you are looking for key tasks and motivations.

- How Often People Will Visit Your Site?
   This depends on your information and type of services.

WireFrames: 
  A simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site.

- The primary aim of any kind of visual design is to communicate. Organizing and prioritizing information on a page helps users understand its importance and what order to read it in.
- Most web users do not read entire pages. Rather, they skim to find information.You can use contrast to create a visual hierarchy that gets across your key message and helps users find what they are looking for.
- Site navigation not only helps people find where they want to go, but also helps them understand what your site is about and how it is organized.

{JAVASCRIPT}

- Being able to change the content of an HTML page while it is loaded in the browser is very powerful.

- You might not want to force visitors to reload the content of an entire web page, particularly if you only need to refresh a small portion of a page.
   Just reloading a section of the page can make a site feel like it is faster to load and more like anapplication.

- If you have a lot of information to display on a page, you can help users find information they need by providing filters.

- A script: is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.

- To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it.
  
  DESIGN THE SCRIPT:
  As tempting as it can be to start coding straight away, it pays to spend time designing your script before you start writing it.
  you should split the goal out into a series of tasks that are going to be involved in solving this puzzle. This can be represented using a flowchart.

- Every step for every task shown in a flowchart needs to be written in a language the computer can understand and follow.
- You need to learn to "think" like a computer because they solve tasks in different ways than you or I might approach them.
- The first thing you should do is detail your goals for the script (what you want it to achieve).
- Often scripts will need to perform different tasks in different situations. You can use flowcharts to work out how the tasks fit together.
- In computer programming, each physica l thing in the world can be represented as an object.
- The idea of name/value pairs is used in both HTML and CSS. In HTML, an attribute is like a property; different attributes have different names, and each attribute can have a value.
- Computers use data to create models of things in the real world. The events, methods, and properties of an object all relate to each other: 
  Events can trigger methods, and methods can retrieve or update an object's properties.
 
  HOW A BROWSER SEES A WEB PAGE:
  1. RECEIVE A PAGE AS HTML CODE.
  2. CREATE A MODEL OF THE PAGE AND STORE IT IN MEMORY.
  3. USE A RENDERING ENGINE TO SHOW THE PAGE ON SCREEN.

- All major browsers use a JavaScript interpreter to translate your instructions (in JavaScript) into instructions the computer can follow.
- There are three layers form the basis of a popular approach to building web pages called progressive enhancement.
- The JavaScript is added last and enhances the usability of the page or the experience of interacting with the site.
- When you want to use JavaScript with a web page, you use the HTML <script> element to tell the browser it is coming across a script.

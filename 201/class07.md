Domain Modeling:
Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem.


What's a Table in html:
A table represents information in a grid format. Examples of tables include financial reports, TV schedules, and sports results.

The <table> element is used to create a table. The contents of the table are written out row by row.

Spanning Columns:
The colspan attribute can be used on a <th> or <td> element and indicates how many columns that cell should run across.

Spanning Rows:
The rowspan attribute can be used on a <th> or <td> element to indicate how many rows a cell should span down the table.



**js**
Sometimes you will want several objects to represent similar things.

Object constructors can use a function as a template for creating objects. First, create the template with the object's properties and methods.


Once you have created an object, the syntax for adding or removing any properties and methods
from that object is the same.



LITERAL NOTATION:
A colon separates the key/value pairs. There is a comma between each key/value pair.


The keyword this is commonly used inside functions and objects.


To organize your data, you can use an array or object to group a set of related values. In arrays and objects the name is also known as a key.

If you want to access items via a property name or key, use an object (but note that each key in the object must be unique).


To access the properties or methods of the object, use dot notation.


The topmost object in the Document Object Model (or DOM) is the document object. It represents the web page loaded into the current browser window or tab.


document . getElementByld(): Returns element, if there is an element with the value of the id attribute
that matches.

document.createElement(): Creates new element.

document.createTextNode(): Creates new text node;

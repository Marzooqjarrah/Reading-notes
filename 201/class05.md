A picture can say a thousand words, and great images help make the difference between an average-looking site and a really engaging one.

If you are building a site from scratch, it is good practice to create a folder for all of the images
the site uses.

To add an image into the page you need to use an <img> element.

If the <img> is followed by a block level element (such as a paragraph) then the block level element will sit on a new line after the imageas shown in the first example on this page.

The align attribute was commonly used to indicate how the other parts of a page should
flow around an image.

When you give the align attribute a value of left, the image is placed on the left and
text flows around it.

The images you use on your website should be saved at the same width and height that you
want them to appear on the page.

When cropping images it is important not to lose valuable information. It is best to source
images that are the correct shape if possible.

Images created for the web should be saved at a resolution of 72 ppi.



**css**

The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element. You can specify any
color in CSS in one of three ways:

CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears in a box, and the background-color property
sets the color of the background for that box.

Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red, green, and blue. To find the color you want, you can use a color picker.

When picking foreground and background colors, it is important to ensure that there is enough contrast for the text to be legible.

The hsl color property has been introduced in CSS3 as an alternative way to specify colors.

hue
This is expressed as an angl (between 0 and 360 degrees).


Choosing a Typeface for your Website:
When choosing a typeface, it is important to understand that a browser will usually only display it if it's
installed on that user's computer.

There are several ways to use fonts other than those listed on the previous page. However, typefaces are subject to copyright, so the techniques you can choose from are limited by their respective licenses.

The font-family property allows you to specify the typeface that should be used for any text inside the element(s) to which a CSS rule applies.

The font-size property enables you to specify a size for the font. There are several ways to
specify the size of a font.


Units of Type Size:
Pixels, Percentages and Ems.


@font-face allows you to use a font, even if it is not installed on the computer of the person browsing, by allowing you to specify a path to a copy of the font, which will be downloaded if it is not on the user's machine.

The font-weight property :allows you to create bold text.

If you want to create italic text, you can use the font-style property.

uppercase: This causes the text to appear uppercase.
lowercase: This causes the text to appear lowercase.

The text-align property allows you to control the alignment of text.

The text-shadow property has become commonly used despite lacking support in all browsers.

The text-indent property allows you to indent the first line of text within an element.


active: 
This is applied when an element is being activated by a user; for example, when a button is being
pressed or a link being clicked.
Sometimes this is used to make


JPEG vs PNG vs GIF:
JPEG images don’t support transparency and are hence not usable for such cases.
PNG images support transparency in two ways — inserting an alpha channel that allows partial transparency or by declaring a single colour as transparent.
GIF images support transparency by declaring a single colour in the colour palette as transparent.

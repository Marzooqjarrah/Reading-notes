What is the hardest thing about writing code?

There are many common answers to this question:
1. Learning a new technology
2. Naming things
3. Testing your code

Simply that by taking away the problem domain, or making it so trivial that it is easily understood, I am able to make both teaching and learning easier.


Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world.

The value of a property can be a st ring, number, Boolean, array, or even another object.


If you had two objects on the same page, you would create each one using the same notation but store them in
variables with different names.


The Document Object Model (DOM) specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JavaScript can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the browser window.

The DOM is called an object model because the model (the DOM tree) is made of objects.

Accessing and updating the DOM tree involves two steps:
1: Locate the node that represents the element you want to work with.
2: Use its text content, child elements, and attributes.


DOM queries may return one element, or they may return a Nodelist, which is a collection of nodes.

When a DOM method can return more than one element, it returns a Nodelist (even if it only finds one matching element).


When you have an element node, you can select another element in relation to it using these five
properties. This is known as traversing the DOM.

The textCon tent property allows you to collect or update just the text that is in the
containing element (and its children).


Modern browsers come with tools that help you inspect the page loaded in the browser and understand the structure of the DOM tree.

Firefox has similar built-in tools, but you can also download a DOM inspector tool that
shows the text nodes.

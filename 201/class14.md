Many of today’s most valuable firms have come to realize that analyzing and improving individual workers ­— a practice known as ‘‘employee performance optimization’’.

Over the past century, psychologists made considerable progress in defining and systematically measuring intelligence in individuals,

What interested the researchers most, however, was that teams that did well on one assignment usually did well on all the others. Conversely, teams that failed at one thing seemed to fail at everything.

researchers sometimes colloquially refer to traits like ‘‘conversational turn-taking’’ and ‘‘average social sensitivity’’ .



**Transforms**


The transform property comes in two different settings, two-dimensional and three-dimensional. Each of these come with their own individual properties and values.


The translate value works a bit like that of relative positioning, pushing and pulling an element in different directions without interrupting the normal flow of the document.


The last transform value in the group, skew, is used to distort elements on the horizontal axis, vertical axis, or both.

Using multiple transform declarations will not work, as each declaration will overwrite the one above it. 

Using the rotateX value allows you to rotate an element around the x axis, as if it were being bent in half horizontally.

Using the rotateY value allows you to rotate an element around the y axis, as if it were being bent in half vertically.


Animations within CSS3 allow the appearance and behavior of an element to be altered in multiple keyframes. 


The transition-property property determines exactly what properties will be altered in conjunction with the other transitional properties.



By default, animations run their cycle once from beginning to end and then stop. To have an animation repeat itself numerous times the animation-iteration-count property may be used.



3D shadows were frowned upon for a year or so, because they weren’t seen as compatible with flat design, which is of course nonsense, they work fantastically well to give a user feedback on their interactions and work with flat, or fake 3D interfaces.

One of the hottest button styles right now is the ghost button; a button with no background and a heavy border.

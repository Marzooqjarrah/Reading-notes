Function in JavaScript:

Calling functions:
Calling the function actually performs the specified actions with the indicated parameters.

Control flow:
The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.
Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops.

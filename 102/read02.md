In the recent years, programmers created Local Version Control systems that stores changes to files. This system entails a single server storing all changes and file versions, which can be accessed by various clients.

GIT: is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots and Git mostly relies on local operations because most necessary information can be found in local resources.

 

To setup a Git Repository:
1.    Switch to the target projectâ€™s directory.
2.    Use the Git init command.
3.    You can also create a copy of an existing Git repository from a particular server by using the clone command.
4.    adding a new file.
5.    commit the changes and record what you did within the commit .
6.    push changes to a remote repository.

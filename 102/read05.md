JavaScript has the following types of operators. This section describes the operators and contains information about operator precedence. 
Types of operators in JS:
1.	Assignment operators
2.	Comparison operators
3.	Arithmetic operators
4.	Bitwise operators
5.	Logical operators
6.	String operators
7.	Conditional (ternary) operator
8.	Comma operator
9.	Unary operators
10.	Relational operators

Assignment operators:
An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. The simple assignment operator is equal (=).

Comparison operators:
A comparison operator compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true. The operands can be numerical, string, logical, or object values.
The sole exceptions to type conversion within comparisons involve the === and !== operators.

Arithmetic operators:
An arithmetic operator takes numerical values (either literals or variables) as their operands and returns a single numerical value. 

An arithmetic operator takes numerical values (either literals or variables) as their operands and returns a single numerical value.
Logical operators:
Logical operators are typically used with Boolean (logical) values; when they are, they return a Boolean value. 
String operators:
The concatenation operator (+) concatenates two string values together, returning another string that is the union of the two operand strings.








(for statement):

A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.

â€¢	When a for loop executes, the following occurs:
-	The initializing expression initial expression, if any, is executed. This expression usually initializes one or more loop counters, but the syntax allows an expression of any degree of complexity. This expression can also declare variables.
-	The condition expression is evaluated. If the value of condition expression is true, the loop statements execute. If the value of condition is false, the for  loop terminates. (If the condition expression is omitted entirely, the condition is assumed to be true.)
-	The statement executes. To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group those statements.

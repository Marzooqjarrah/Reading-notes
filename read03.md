Wireframing
Wireframing is a practice used by UX designers which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, applications.
When designing for the screen you need to know where all the information is going to, which can help tremendously in early conversations about your website or product.
You can imagine how much quantitative and qualitative data those various phases will produce, that’s what you need to keep in mind while drawing out your wireframes. If you’re a mere mortal, you might struggle to both retain and recall all of that, so I recommend scribbling a cheatsheet with your business and user goals.
Mozilla HTML Basics
HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words ,can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.
The main parts of our element are as follows:
1.	The opening tag.
2.	The closing tag.
3.	The content.
4.	The element.






Semantics
Semantics in HTML gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) of "a top level heading on your page”.

HTML should be coded to represent the data that will be populated and not based on its default presentation styling.
Semantic naming mirrors proper custom element/component naming.

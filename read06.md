CSS: (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages.
Headings will look larger than regular text, paragraphs break onto a new line and have space between them. Links are colored and underlined to distinguish them from the rest of the text.  Using CSS you can control exactly how HTML elements look in the browser, presenting your markup using whatever design you like.
CSS is a rule-based language — you define rules specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web pages. Using CSS, the language is broken down into modules.

Three Ways to Insert CSS:
•	External CSS
•	Internal CSS
•	Inline CSS
** The better one is External CSS.
If some properties have been defined for the same selector (element) in different style sheets, the value from the last read style sheet will be used.
